                    <p>In 1964, AT&T (Western Electric) and Bell Labs demonstrated their picturephone 
                        system at the New York World’s Fair.<sup>1</sup> These picturephones – equipped with 
                        two-way video and audio – aimed to meet management and executive needs. Despite 
                        an aggressive ad campaign and continually reducing rates, the picturephone would 
                        remain largely unused throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. Market research 
                        performed by Western Electric found that there was wide interest in the 
                        technology; and yet, factors such as small screen sizes, graphics limitations, 
                        and – most importantly – a lack of applications prevented users from adopting the 
                        picturephone. In 1972, after an unsuccessful campaign to market the picturephone, 
                        all further developments of the device were halted.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Despite its commercial failure, the picturephone represents a significant turning 
                        point in the history of videoconferencing. Through market research, the industry 
                        had gathered extensive documentation on what consumers wanted, as well as their 
                        behaviors with the technology. As they discovered, the use of teleconferencing 
                        technologies would be shaped by users and their behavior, not the other way around.

                    <p>Pictel Corporation (later renamed to Picturetel Corporation) was founded in 1984 
                        by two MIT students and their professor. In its infancy, the team was focused on 
                        developing a codec, or “an algorithm for compressing and decompressing video 
                        images from capture to transmission and eventual display.”<sup>2</sup> Their first 
                        video communications product – the C-2000 – reached the market in the summer of 1986. 
                        Their success in reducing costs and achieving market adoption demonstrated the 
                        potential for video communications technology, and from there, the industry took 
                        off. <br/><br/>
                        Following their disruptive debut, Picturetel continued to improve their video and 
                        audio quality. In 1988, they introduced the C-3000, which utilized their new video 
                        compression algorithm. The C-3000 offered a better visual and auditory experience 
                        at a much lower cost than its competitors, further marking Picturetel as an industry 
                        leader. <br/><br/>
                        Beyond their products, Picturetel was also a key contributor to video standards; 
                        namely, the H.320 standard which specified videoconferencing standards over ISDN 
                        networks. Picturetel’s influence and revenue continued to grow over the next decade.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>Cu-SeeMe was a free desktop video conferencing system developed at Cornell University 
                        in 1992.<sup>1</sup> Designed for both Macintosh and Windows, Cu-SeeMe aimed at reaching as many 
                        users as possible. The program was able to run on inexpensive computers with minimal 
                        network connectivity, allowing for fast, accessible, interpersonal communication.<sup>2</sup> 
                        Cu-SeeMe also allowed users to private message each other through “talk windows” or 
                        “chat boxes,” a feature that addressed Picturephone-era concerns that a video call 
                        would be too awkward to use regularly. <br/><br/>
                        Having been developed by university students, CU-SeeMe immediately appealed to 
                        university settings. A study on collaborative technologies in inter-university 
                        settings found a use case of CU-SeeMe that particularly fit professors’ needs: 
                        “faculty collaboration sessions or meetings with students where the interaction was 
                        brief and the purpose of the communication was conveyed mostly by voice.”<sup>3</sup>
                        <br/><br/>
                        Following the example of MIT and Picturetel, CU-SeeMe is another instance of 
                        videoconferencing being driven by university settings. As efforts to maximize 
                        academic productivity accelerated, so did efforts to improve video conferencing 
                        technologies.

                    <p>The Cisco Telepresence System 3000 (CTS-3000) was a product released within a batch of Cisco 
                        telepresence products in 2006.<sup>1</sup> Focused at emulating a truly immersive experience, 
                        the CTS-3000 utilized “three 65-inch plasma screens; multi-channel discrete, spatial audio with 
                        echo cancellation per channel; microphones; lighting; Ethernet and power ports in the table legs, 
                        and a professional-quality table that seats six on each side.”<sup>2</sup> <br/><br/>
                        Developers at Cisco were committed to the idea of creating a lifelike video conferencing experience, 
                        such that their mantra became “it’s all about the experience.” Additional factors they emphasized in 
                        creating the CTS-3000 were ease of use and reliability. The CTS-3000 needed to be accessible and 
                        intuitive to all, and it needed to work time after time – without fail. <br/><br/>
                        Just seven years after its release, the CTS-3000 was retired.<sup>3</sup> While Cisco seemingly had 
                        its users in mind, adoption for the CTS-3000 was low, with most evidence of its existence today being 
                        constrained to prototypes, mock-ups, or diagrams from a user manual spanning 216 pages.<sup>4</sup>
