                        Face pareidolia refers to the tendency to detect faces in ambiguous visual information. This  phenomenon occurs–in part–because of the supreme importance of faces in our social life.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, research supports the idea that nonverbal behaviors and eye contact contribute more towards neural synchrony than speech alone, which is an important factor in building teamwork.<sup>2</sup><br/><br/>
Productive teamwork is particularly important in environments such as universities and workplaces, as both settings involve regular meetings with others to work towards a common goal (whether that be academic research or meeting company demands). As such, it is understandable that a sizable amount of funding has gone into developing bigger, better, faster, and more efficient forms of communication–regardless of physical distance.<br/><br/>
This exhibit will take you on a journey of the various attempts at video conferencing technologies from the 1960s to the 2010s. Through discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each artifact, you will discover how video conferencing technology history was shaped by its consumers, and how the proliferation of video calling today reflects countless iterations by many stakeholders. In addition, you will learn the key role that educational institutions played in the early development of video conferencing devices/platforms.<br/><br/>
In the end, you will see how, despite claims about disruptions, the surviving video conferencing platforms that exist today were less motivated by novelty and more focused on user experience and accessibility as targeted consumer audiences shifted from company executives to a broader group of people: everyone.

                    <p>In 1964, AT&T (Western Electric) and Bell Labs demonstrated their picturephone 
                        system at the New York World’s Fair.<sup>1</sup> These picturephones–equipped with 
                        two-way video and audio–aimed to meet management and executive needs. Despite 
                        an aggressive ad campaign and continually reducing rates, the picturephone would 
                        remain largely unused throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. Market research 
                        performed by Western Electric found that there was wide interest in the 
                        technology; and yet, factors such as small screen sizes, graphics limitations, 
                        and–most importantly–a lack of applications prevented users from adopting the 
                        picturephone. In 1972, after an unsuccessful campaign to market the picturephone, 
                        all further developments of the device were halted.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Despite its commercial failure, the picturephone represents a significant turning 
                        point in the history of videoconferencing. Through market research, the industry 
                        had gathered extensive documentation on what consumers wanted, as well as their 
                        behaviors with the technology. As they discovered, the use of teleconferencing 
                        technologies would be shaped by users and their behavior, not the other way around.

                    <p>Pictel Corporation (later renamed to Picturetel Corporation) was founded in 1984 
                        by two MIT students and their professor. In its infancy, the team was focused on 
                        developing a codec, or “an algorithm for compressing and decompressing video 
                        images from capture to transmission and eventual display.”<sup>2</sup> Their first 
                        video communications product–the C-2000–reached the market in the summer of 1986. 
                        Their success in reducing costs and achieving market adoption demonstrated the 
                        potential for video communications technology, and from there, the industry took 
                        off. <br/><br/>
                        Following their disruptive debut, Picturetel continued to improve their video and 
                        audio quality. In 1988, they introduced the C-3000, which utilized their new video 
                        compression algorithm. The C-3000 offered a better visual and auditory experience 
                        at a much lower cost than its competitors, further marking Picturetel as an industry 
                        leader. <br/><br/>
                        Beyond their products, Picturetel was also a key contributor to video standards; 
                        namely, the H.320 standard which specified videoconferencing standards over ISDN 
                        networks. Picturetel’s influence and revenue continued to grow over the next decade.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>Cu-SeeMe was a free desktop video conferencing system developed at Cornell University 
                        in 1992.<sup>1</sup> Designed for both Macintosh and Windows, Cu-SeeMe aimed at reaching as many 
                        users as possible. The program was able to run on inexpensive computers with minimal 
                        network connectivity, allowing for fast, accessible, interpersonal communication.<sup>2</sup> 
                        Cu-SeeMe also allowed users to private message each other through “talk windows” or 
                        “chat boxes,” a feature that addressed Picturephone-era concerns that a video call 
                        would be too awkward to use regularly. <br/><br/>
                        Having been developed by university students, CU-SeeMe immediately appealed to 
                        university settings. A study on collaborative technologies in inter-university 
                        settings found a use case of CU-SeeMe that particularly fit professors’ needs: 
                        “faculty collaboration sessions or meetings with students where the interaction was 
                        brief and the purpose of the communication was conveyed mostly by voice.”<sup>3</sup>
                        <br/><br/>
                        Following the example of MIT and Picturetel, CU-SeeMe is another instance of 
                        videoconferencing being driven by university settings. As efforts to maximize 
                        academic productivity accelerated, so did efforts to improve video conferencing 
                        technologies.

                    <p>The Cisco Telepresence System 3000 (CTS-3000) was a product released within a batch of Cisco 
                        telepresence products in 2006.<sup>1</sup> Focused at emulating a truly immersive experience, 
                        the CTS-3000 utilized “three 65-inch plasma screens; multi-channel discrete, spatial audio with 
                        echo cancellation per channel; microphones; lighting; Ethernet and power ports in the table legs, 
                        and a professional-quality table that seats six on each side.”<sup>2</sup> <br/><br/>
                        Developers at Cisco were committed to the idea of creating a lifelike video conferencing experience, 
                        such that their mantra became “it’s all about the experience.” Additional factors they emphasized in 
                        creating the CTS-3000 were ease of use and reliability. The CTS-3000 needed to be accessible and 
                        intuitive to all, and it needed to work time after time–without fail. <br/><br/>
                        Just seven years after its release, the CTS-3000 was retired.<sup>3</sup> While Cisco seemingly had 
                        its users in mind, adoption for the CTS-3000 was low, with most evidence of its existence today being 
                        constrained to prototypes, mock-ups, or diagrams from a user manual spanning 216 pages.<sup>4</sup>

                    <p>Technology company Apple announced Group FaceTime in 2018, approximately seven years after their 
                        FaceTime app was introduced.<sup>1</sup> Group FaceTime enabled 2-32 people to join a call, with 
                        features such as automatic detection of active speakers being added to handle the potential chaos 
                        of multiple users in one call. Participants’ videos would appear as “bubbles” on the screen that 
                        would resize based on their speech activity. Additionally, Group FaceTime was seamlessly integrated 
                        into iPhones’ Phone and Messages app, allowing users to quickly join or create group calls.<br/><br/>
                        Group FaceTime addressed the desire for a mobile, convenient form of video conferencing; however, it 
                        was also limited by its medium. Jitters, frame freeze, and video stalls were common occurrences over 
                        mobile video chat, disrupting the illusion of an immersive, face-to-face conversation.<sup>2</sup>
                        <br/><br/>
                        An apparent tension had arisen between user experience and accessibility; and over the next few years 
                        and continuing into the present, technology companies would continue to work on bridging the gap 
                        between the two.

                        From the telegraph to MySpace to Meta’s Horizon Worlds, countless efforts have been made throughout 
                        history to connect humans across physical barriers. Following this trend, video conferencing 
                        technologies arose to meet the needs of more interpersonal interactions in the workplace.<br/><br/>
                        The Picturephone was the first to broach this issue, but ultimately failed to gain traction because 
                        of its difficulty to find applications. The technology had been created, but not the use case.<br/><br/>
                        Learning from the Picturephone’s mistakes, Picturetel Corporation rose to attention nearly two decades 
                        later. Picturetel’s emphasis on quality sedimented video conferencing as a tool that people would want 
                        in their homes; still, everyday people would not yet adopt the technology, instead electing for 
                        traditional telephone forms of communication.<br/><br/>
                        With CU-SeeMe, the industry finally saw a form of video conferencing accessible to many. CU-SeeMe 
                        could be downloaded on desktop computers free of charge, which opened the door to anyone with a 
                        computer–not just company executives with access to bulky, expensive, high-tech equipment, as 
                        represented by the Cisco Telepresence System 3000.<br/><br/>
                        Moving into the present, Apple’s FaceTime brought group video calling to anyone with an iPhone, and 
                        later, anyone with a device with Internet access.<br/><br/>
                        Collectively, these artifacts represent a continuous journey to connect humans. The ones that survived 
                        didn’t necessarily create the flashiest, most disruptive technology, but instead created something to 
                        meet consumer needs. Video conferencing history–as this exhibit argues–was driven and shaped by 
                        everyday consumers, and its purpose has shifted over time from facilitating workplace meetings to now 
                        being the mode of regular communication.
